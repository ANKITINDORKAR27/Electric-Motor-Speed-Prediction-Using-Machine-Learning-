Electric Motor Speed Prediction
The goal is to predict motor speed based on the other attributes available in the dataset. This includes sensor Data such as
ambient temperature, coolant temperature, voltage and current components, torque and temperature Measurements of various
parts of the motor. The goal is likely to improve performance and efficiency of the Permanent magnet synchronous motor
(PMSM) by understanding the relationship between the sensor data and motor speed.
